2. You should use ID when it is for an unique element and use classes when you are gonna use it for multiple elements.
3. RGBA means Red, Green, Blue and Alpha. You can express all colours in the RGB spectrum, that means colours with red, green and blue and them mixed together aswell as transparency which is determined by the alpha value.
