1. There is a #D context for canvas, but it is not called 3D as expected. Rather it is called WebGL. By running getContext('webgl') we get a 3D type of canvas.
2. We can create a blue circle by first setting the fillstyle to blue and then using the canvas arc() method and setting the start angle to 0 and the end angle to 2*pi (aka 360 degrees).
3. The Array filter method() will return a new array with elements that went through the function you put it through so you can setup an array filter that checks for countries starting with N then return the result.
