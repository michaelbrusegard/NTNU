        <p>I have coded before, but I do not have well established coding skills. In High School I had a course called ProgMod (Programming and modelling) where I learned some basic Python and I even made a simple platformer game during that, but we used the python knowledge mostly for solving math that required it for instance calculating approximation of values.</p>
        <p>I also learned some very basic Javascript in my leisure time to create a Discord Music Bot for some friends. I used a library that did most of the heavy lifting, but I did learn some string manipulation. I also made a super simple webpage before using HTML and CSS during a year of boarding school (folkeh√∏yskole). It was all very basic and I have a lot to learn which I look forward to doing in this course.</p>
        <p>My expectations for this course is to learn basic web developing in a sense where I remember most of the basics so I do not have to google everything when I am trying to create a basic web page. I also really want to make a webpage for a professional photographer I know when we are doing the project. I know the value of learning web developing and I am looking really foreard to it. I hope I am going to meet some challenges that I can overcome and learn from.</p>
